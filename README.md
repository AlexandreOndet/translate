# Translation Guidelines
Help csTimer+ to reach more people by translating our texts!

## Disclaimer

Anyone is welcome to contribute to our global expansion, by translating our texts to one of the 30 languages currently supported.

Any help will be greatly appreciated and credited in every new release of the extension, but before diving into the translation, read this carefully:
1. Every translation should be either based on the en-us.js, or pt-pt.js files, these are languages maintained by the extension's creator and will be always updated on every release.
2. Any untranslated text will be set to english by default, so you should not and there's no need to copy every single text from en-us if you're not willing to translate all of them.
3. Not every text can be thoroughly reviewed, so translate at your own discretion.
4. English re-translations are welcomed, including the README file, if you feel that something is a little bit off.
5. Keep an eye on this repository to check if there are any new texts to translate.
6. When you're finished contributing, open a pull request to integrate your translation to the final product.

## Upcoming features

There'll be an exclusive repository to publish inspection voices in other languages and only those who contributed to this repo will be eligible to maintain and publish their audio files.
